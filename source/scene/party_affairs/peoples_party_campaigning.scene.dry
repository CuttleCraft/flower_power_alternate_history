@campaign_workers
title: Campaign among the workers, to assuage their doubts about our changes.
on-arrival: workers_dove += 5*(1-dissent);

The workers are still a key part of our constituency, and we must not alienate them in the transformation of our party.

@campaign_middle
title: Campaign among the middle classes.
on-arrival: youth_dove += 5*(1-dissent); consumer_dove += 5*(1-dissent)

As a people's party, we represent the employees and small businesspeople of the middle class, and they are becoming receptive to our messages.

@campaign_rural
title: Campaign in rural areas.
choose-if: rural_policy > 0
unavailable-subtitle: We have not enacted any rural policies yet.
on-arrival: rural_dove += 6*(1-dissent)

As a people's party, we represent farmers and rural workers as well, and they are becoming receptive to our messages.

@campaign_unemployed
title: Campaign among the unemployed.
on-arrival: unemployed_dove += 5*(1-dissent);

As a people's party, the urban poor are still a key part of our constituency.

@campaign_women
title: Campaign among women of all classes.
on-arrival: workers_dove += 3*(1-dissent); consumer_dove += 3*(1-dissent); youth_dove += 3*(1-dissent); rural_dove += 3*(1-dissent); unemployed_dove += 3*(1-dissent);

As a people's party, we represent women of all classes.

@campaign_black
title: Campaign among political black.
on-arrival: black_dove += 5*(1-dissent);

black have historically been tied to the Center Party, but there is no reason why our party cannot appeal to them. The Prussian Concordat in particular is a sign of our friendship with Catholicism.
