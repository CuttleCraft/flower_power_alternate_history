On the contrary, the conduct of individual leaders is determined largely by the sentiments of the people as a whole. It would be erroneous, however, to regard the sentiments of the moment as reflecting the natural make-up and character of the people.

= August 1968

After a long and tumultuous campaign, it is finally time for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago under the watchful eye of Mayor Daley. Eugene McCarthy has emerged as the strongest antiwar candidate with the highest chance of ousting the establishment and pro-war pick, Hubert Humphrey, after McGovern failed to effectively continue Robert Kennedy's own bid. He drives towards the Conrad Hilton hotel, cheered on by thousands. When Hubert Humphrey follows, the streets turn silent.

- @convention_begins: The convention begins.
- @mccarthy_convention: Skip intro.
- @debug_skip: DEBUG: No 1968 run.

@convention_begins
new-page: true

The International Ampitheatre fills quickly, oblivious to the Yippie "Festival of Life" outside, and soon convention proceedings begin. Quickly, the split of the party on anti-war and pro-war lines becomes blatantly clear as Hubert Humphrey puts forward his proposal for a party platform, written under pressure from LBJ. The proposal is debated for three hours as the anti-war democrats oppose the platform, before finally being voted on.

- @plank_passes: The platform passes.

@plank_passes
new-page: true

Despite the virulent opposition of the anti-war faction of the Democratic party, the platform passes with the support of 60% of delegates, and a peace plank proposed by anti-war democrats is defeated. In protest, New York's delegates put on black armbands and begin singing "We Shall Overcome" while meanwhile the situation in the streets continues to deteriorate as the police aggressively suppress the growing anti-war protests.

After an exhausting August 27th, anti-war and pro-war convention delegates alike retired to Conrad Hilton hotel for rest. Later that night, now the early hours of August 28th, 5,000 protestors assembled outside the Conrad Hilton hotel and around Grant Park. Worried for the safety of the hotel and authoritarian as ever, Mayor Daley chose to deploy the national guard, geared for battle, to Michigan Avenue, which was between the Conrad Hilton hotel and Grant Park. A standoff ensues, before eventually the police are ordered to clear the streets. The ensuing violence becomes known as the "Battle of Michigan Avenue"; a 17-minute melee where police beat, club and arrest protestors, bystanders and journalists indiscriminately, even chasing them into the Conrad Hilton hotel itself. Tear gas is fired and batons fly through the air as war is waged in the streets. Senator Ribicoff denounces Daley's gestapo tactics, and when the convention is adjourned for the day many anti-war delegates go straight to Grant Park to join the protestors. But most importantly, voting for the Democratic nominee concludes.

- @humphrey: Hubert Humphrey wins on the first ballot.

Despite little to no popular support to his name, the Democratic establishment is powerful enough to force the issue. Hubert Humphrey is nominated, and Eugene McCarthy gives a speech to the protestors of the night before in Grant Park.

- @third_party_run: Eugene McCarthy is asked to run as a candidate for the Peace and Freedom Party.

@third_party_run

It takes a lot of convincing to sway a reluctant senator McCarthy, but after being assured the support of many of his close advisors and allies, and being encouraged by the Mobe and many anti-war groups, Eugene McCarthy is swayed.

Now, the Peace and Freedom Party must choose where to hold its convention and how to organize it. We have a multitude of options at our disposal.

- @chicago: We will nominate Eugene McCarthy in Chicago, in defiance of Daley's crackdowns.
- @detroit: We will nominate Eugene McCarthy in Detroit, in solidarity with ongoing strikes there.
- @san_francisco: We will nominate Eugene McCarthy in San Francisco, the home of the Summer of Love.

As the dust begins to settle in Chicago, we choose to quickly organize a convention there for the nomination of Eugene McCarthy. However, we have a limited presence in Chicago, and without help organizing the convention from elements already there, we will face difficulty in our aims.

- @yippie: We will invite the Yippies to organize and participate in the convention.
- @progressive: We will invite the antiwar delegates from the Democratic Convention.
- @mobe: The Mobe and other antiwar groups active in the protests are our best bet.

It takes some convincing to get the radical Yippies to agree, seemingly still intent on running a pig for office. However, with help convincing from moderate Phil Ochs, they eventually come around and agree that Eugene McCarthy makes just as fine a pig. They work quickly, rallying the protestors still in the city. When Eugene McCarthy arrives at the convention hall the Yippies have prepared, he is taken aback. Bedraggled protestors mill about, while posters line the walls with radical messaging emblazoned. The floor is lined with scattered underground newspapers, and ahead of him, the podium expected appears more of a soapbox. Before McCarthy can have second thoughts, he is greeted by Abbie Hoffman, who leads him in past the cheering attendees. The convention begins, and many speakers walk up to the soapbox, our Peace and Freedom delegates and Yippies alike, unsettling McCarthy further. Nevertheless, by the end of the day he is nominated, with, for better or worse, the noncommittal backing of the Yippies, whose ideas have entered the party discourse.

It takes some convincing to get the McGovernites to agree to attend, but eventually he is pursuaded, though attends solely as an observer for the time being. An orderly convention is organized, though quite modest due to the haste of preparation and lack of resources. Eugene McCarthy is greeted by modest applause and takes a seat as the convention proceeds. Speeches are made, calling for an end to the Vietnam War, support for Civil Rights, and other such standard progressive promises. By the end of it, McCarthy is officially nominated in a vote by our attending delegates, and ties built with the remaining McGovernites in the Democratic Party, should we attempt to secure a Democratic ally.

The Mobe is happy to help organize and participate in our convention, and quickly organize that of their protestors who remain in the city in support of Eugene McCarthy. When he arrives at the convention he is greeted by a large crowd of protestors who cheer him on. He is greeted by Rennie Davis, one of the leaders of the Chicago office of the Mobe, and led inside into the convention. The convention begins and resounding speeches are made by multiple Mobe speakers as well as our delegates, and by the end of it Eugene McCarthy is officially nominated for president.

With our limited presence in Detroit, it is difficult to organize a convention there. However, we manage to rally enough participants that one is possible. Invitations are sent out left and right to labor and union organizers, hoping to gain enough participants, even if observers, that the event can truly be good publicity. Among those to agree is Walter Reuther, though for the time being solely as an observer. Despite initial fears, the convention can go ahead! Eugene McCarthy travels to Detroit from Chicago quickly, and Walter Reuther is impressed by the strong advocacy for worker's rights expressed in the convention, as well, of course, by the commitment to civil rights and ending the war, though such focus on worker's rights disappoints some of McCarthy's core youth base. Eugene McCarthy is nominated, and as the convention ends even meets with representatives of the local black community. All in all, a great success, with talk of a UAW endorsement floating around.

California is by far the state with our strongest presence, especially in the Bohemian capital of America, San Francisco. We are quickly able to organize a grand convention, and plaster posters all throughout the hip world of San Francisco. We exceed even our own expectations in attendees, and Eugene McCarthy is greeted by great applause as he arrives in California from Chicago. Even the remaining Diggers have made an appearance, and in the following convention Eugene McCarthy is in a landslide confirmed as the Peace and Freedom Party's nominee, to more thunderous applause from the attendants.
